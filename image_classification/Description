Image analysis or image processing is the most researched topic in deep learning. Image processing simply means extracting information from images
and learning from images. This is an important aspect of computer vision. In deep learning, image processing is largely done using convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and can be generally divided into image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and so on.
